# To Do

## Path

- level_data screen class (`level_data["0_0_0"].geo` instead of `level_data["0_0_0"]["geo"]`)
  - Need to do .objects, palette, title, area, transition, music, decos, object_id, name
  - Most will be easy except objects and decos because they're lists

## Decoding

- Add decoding paint and geo

- Fun paint & geo classes!

## Monitor

- Add monitoring playdata with events for changes.

## Palettes

- For getting each palette and its colours

# Possibly Do

- Perhaps some utils related to gamemakers weird way of doing things, like how rgb is backwards for some reason

- Finish rest of _playdata things we don't know what it does

# Formatting

- Make docstrings uniform and useful
  - Parameters
  - Return types
  - Errors
