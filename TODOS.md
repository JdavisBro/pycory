# To Do

## Path

- Only save Playdata when dict is changed, not loaded
  - This can be done with a dict subclass

- Finish rest of _playdata lines

- level_data class and finder
  - Can add a reader and writer too, just a dict.

## Decoding

- Add decoding paint and geo

## Monitor

- Add monitoring playdata with events for changes.

# Possibly Do

- Perhaps some utils related to gamemakers weird way of doing things, like how rgb is backwards for some reason

# Formatting

- Make docstrings uniform and useful
  - Parameters
  - Return types
  - Errors
